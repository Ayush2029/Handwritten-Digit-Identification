# Handwritten-Digit-Identification

This project is a full-stack application for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It consists of a trained CNN model, a FastAPI backend for inference, and a frontend HTML page for users to draw or upload digits for prediction. <br>

<h4>Features: </h4><br>
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on MNIST <br>
- FastAPI backend for digit prediction via file upload <br>
- Responsive frontend with drawing pad and image upload <br>
- Confusion matrix, accuracy curves, and loss graphs in notebook <br>
- Fully local and offline-capable <br>
